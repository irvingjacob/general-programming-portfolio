<p> Object Oriented Programming is a programming concept that uses objects that contain data about themselves and can include functions to be worked with. When you're working with objects, each instance of an object can have unique values for its attributes. Object oriented programming differs from procedural as you can make your own types and have several objects that are the same thing, but are different. For instance, you can have two rectangle objects. Both are rectangles, but each has different attributes and unique lengths and widths. Procedural programming moreso refers to a sequential route of programming. A code runs from top to bottom and then finishes.</p>
<p> Inheritence is when you a class is based off of an existing class or object of another class. </p>
<p> An instance of Polymorphism would be like a class for a vehicle, a truck, and a boat. You have a class, vehicle, that holds data manufacturer, year made, and maybe some other data. A truck is a vehicle, a thus inherits from the vehicle class. A boat does the same thing. However, a truck and a boat are very different while both are vehicles. A boat is a vehicle but a boat isn't a truck and vice versa. Polymorphism uses an "is a" type of relationship</p>
<p> C++ and C# are very similar languages by nature. C++ was actually the first programming language I learned and practiced, which seems opposite to most of my peers. My intorduction ot programming was in c++. I learned c++ in a terminal environment and used it to write small odd tasks. The biggest difference I see between the two is that C# is inherently based on object oriented programing. In c++ I never needed to convert an integer to a string to output it, I just output it. I also worked a lot in c++ working with pointers and memory locations, and even making programs where I reference objects and variabls based on pointers to their memory location rather than their names. In c#, you can't even access the memory location, which is safer, really.</p>
