Testing this project
1) Input validation:
User can enter whatever they wish. They are instructed that if they enter values that don't work, it
will default to a specific value. They can input colors in the form of #XXXXXX or 'colorname'
In testing the HTML response, it worked every time.
2) structuring classes
I took each class and seperated them bit by bit. I started by making an html class that had everything
in it. These main values are h1 tags and pTags. In development, I realized style and table should not 
be a part of this class to maintain efficiency, so they were taken out and put into their own.
To test the functionality of the classes, I bit by bit sent the user inputted values or hard coded
strings into the generate finctions, and then checked the output html to ensure that it was correct.
3)stlye sheet and table
the style sheet was the most easily constructed. the default constructor set plain values and the 
overloaded allowed users to select their values. The table was not quite so easy. For documentation 
about inputting the file, see files lab as that's where most all the processing for fil input came from
I did have some issues with the set up of the table and determining where the tr tags should go. 
I'm sure there is a much more efficient way to do it than how I did however.
4) file outputs
After running the code several times, I could see where issues were based on these debug logs, and if
certain portions of my code ran or didn't ran. Pretty helpful.
5) I tested the overall html by checking the webpage and seeing how things would adjust based off of 
different outputs.
