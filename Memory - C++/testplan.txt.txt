Testing this project was a lot of work.

The first test was validation of input. I input a variety of valid inputs and garbage inputs to
ensure that the console was only taking useful data. The valid entries were numbers 1-9. any numbers
greater or lower than those needed to promt the user to enter something different. However, I also
had to ensure that the numbers were handled correctly, as the input of the numebr 9 had a specific 
purpose. In that scenario, we accepted the number 9 as valid output but I had to ensure it had seperate 
functionality. 

Afterwards, I had to make sure the guesses were being stored properly and couldn't be guessed twice.
I did this using two other arrays that held matched numbers and the guessed numbers. if they weren't
the preloaded value AND they were the same value, then the user guessed correctly. Each time the user
guessed correctly that value needed to be stored so they couldn't cheese the game into thinking they 
had won. 

I tested different coordinates that I knew matched or didnt match to ensure that the game always output 
and stored values for successes and attempts correctly.
