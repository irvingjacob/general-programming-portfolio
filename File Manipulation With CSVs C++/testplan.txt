Testing this program was several steps.

First, making sure my input was validated. Simple. Just type in garbage, make sure it prompts again, 
type it right, and viola, it works.

Next is actually making sure what I'm doing with files is right. I set up my infile and tested
(I believe there might be scrap comments in my code of this stage) that I could access what is in 
it by outputting it to the console. Golden.

Next, outfiles. I made a few test files not included in turning this assignment in in which I just had
simple text documents that I hard coded hello worlds into. Perfect.

SO now that I can output files, I can start working with the data I need. Well, no, because I did it
wrong. I opened my files in the constructor and then tried to open them again in a loop no less. In trying
to manipulate data from my files, I would only ever get the last entry as it would overwrite rather 
than append. Take out the open statements, whatya know, it works when it's only opened once. 

Now the actual processing. Simple console out statements made it easy to ensure what I had in my headers 
array was correct. And simply opening the output files after I closed the program would show me
if I was either a column off, fetching the wrong data, or if my logic was just off and nothing was
happening at all.

Testing this program was actually considerably fun. And in the end, it all worked.
