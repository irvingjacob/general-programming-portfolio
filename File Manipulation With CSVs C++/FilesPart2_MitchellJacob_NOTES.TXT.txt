Jacob Mitchell - Files Part 2

I did not edit the base csv file

Everything I included in the assignment works and works fine. I did not finish working with the 
text qualifiers. I included some logic on how they should work and how it would go if I included
them. You will see it in the program. Most all issues are included in comments in the code.

My biggest standstills are really just that I spent too much time troubleshooting why my files kept 
overwriting themselves that by the time I could work with everything, I didn't have much time left.
I've once again bit off a bit more than I could chew. But here I am.
